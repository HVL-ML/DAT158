## Getting started

:point_right: You find the course notebooks here: [/notebooks](/notebooks).

:computer: :cloud: To work with the code material in DAT158 you have two choices: installing software locally on your own computer or using cloud services.

### Set up your computer

Go to [Set up your computer](./setup.md) for step-by-step instructions for how to install the necessary software on your own computer.

### Use cloud services

The easiest way to get going is to use cloud services like Google Colab, Kaggle Notebooks, or Deepnote (whichever you prefer).

 - [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com): Select "Open notebook" :arrow_forward: GitHub :arrow_forward: Enter `HVL-ML/DAT158` and select a notebook -- or simply click here: ![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
 - [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code): Select "New notebook" :arrow_forward: File :arrow_forward: Import :arrow_forward: GitHub and search for `HVL-ML/DAT158`
 - [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/): Click here: [![DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/buttons/launch-in-deepnote-small.svg)](https://deepnote.com/launch?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FHVL-ML%2FDAT158)

You can also browse the notebooks (non-interactively) using nbviewer: [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/HVL-ML/DAT158-2023/tree/main/notebooks)
